# Submissions

## Sending a Manuscript

### Step One

Prepare your manuscript using the [LaTeX template](https://github.com/replication-studies/latex-template).

## Step Two

Fork [this](https://github.com/replication-studies/submissions) repository to your GitHub account.

Copy the Quarto and/or LaTeX files from your manuscript into `lastname-title-year` (e.g., `doe-gravity-2024`) in your forked repository. Include all the files required to render the PDF (e.g., plots).

### Step Three

Do not include data files or any other files that are not required to compile the PDF.

If your manuscript uses raw data, make sure to subset it or prepare files with the plots and/or tables to use them directly in the manuscript.

Move all the raw data and processing code to a separate repository and include a link to it in your manuscript.

### Step Four

Verify that your manuscript compiles without errors on your computer.

### Step Five

Submit a pull request to the [submissions](https://github.com/replication-studies/submissions) repository.

## Reviewing a Manuscript

We'll assign one reviewer to the manuscript. The reviewer will provide feedback on the manuscript and the replication code.

## Checking Scope

The reviewer will check if the manuscript fits the scope of the journal and if it complies with the submission guidelines.

## Applying Changes

If the reviewer consideres the manuscript is acceptable, there may be requested changes that you'll need to apply and answer all the questions made on the GitHub review.

## Acceptance

Once the reviewer considers the manuscript is ready, it will be accepted for publication and it will get a DOI number. The article will appear [here](https://github.com/replication-studies/articles).

## Payment

There is payment required to publish in the journal, but the journal is open access and non-profit. The payment is used to cover the costs of the journal and to pay the reviewers.

The publication fee is charges in two parts:

* There is a fee of 45 USD to determine the scope and quality of the manuscript to be paid initially. 30 USD cover the reviewer and 15 USD cover the journal administration.
* If the manuscript is considered acceptable for publication, there is a fee for the full review, which will be 30 USD per hour of review, with a cap of total five (5) hours of review including the manuscript scope check. The reviewer will provide an estimate of the total review time after they consider the article acceptable for publication and before starting the review. The authors must agree to these fees before the scope check starts and the editors will abide to charge their estimation if their incur in more time than the estimated.

The publication fees are **not** a guarantee of publication. We will not refund the initial fee if the manuscript is not accepted for publication, if the authors decide to withdraw the manuscript, or if the authors do not agree with the requested changes.

The payment is made through [Wise](https://wise.com), a secure payment platform. The journal will provide the payment details internally.
